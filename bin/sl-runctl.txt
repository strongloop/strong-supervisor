  set-size <N>               Set cluster size to N workers.
  stop                       Stop, shutdown all workers and stop controller.
  restart                    Restart, restart all workers.
  ls [DEPTH]                 List application dependencies.
  objects-start <ID>         Start tracking objects on ID.
  objects-stop <ID>          Stop tracking objects on ID.
      Object metrics are published, see the `--metrics` option to `slc run`.

  cpu-start <ID> [TIMEOUT]   Start CPU profiling on ID.
      TIMEOUT is the optional watchdog timeout, in milliseconds.  In watchdog

      i.e. when a script is running for too long.  Only supported on Linux.

  cpu-stop <ID> [NAME]       Stop CPU profiling on ID, save as "NAME.cpuprofile".
      CPU profiles must be loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is optional,
      profiles default to being named `node.<PID>.cpuprofile`.

  heap-snapshot <ID> [NAME]  Snapshot heap objects for ID, save as
                             "NAME.heapsnapshot".
      Heap snapshots must be loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is
      optional, snapshots default to being named `node.<PID>.heapshapshot`.

  patch <ID> <FILE>          Apply patch FILE to ID.

ID, and use an ID of `0` to mean the cluster master.
